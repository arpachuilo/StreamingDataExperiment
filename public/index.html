  <h3 style="padding-top: 20px;">Introduction</h3>
  <p>The purpose of this page is to provide you with information that may affect your decision whether or not to participate in this research study. If you agree, you will be asked to participate in a research study that tests users situational awareness while monitoring a streaming data set. This is done by asking participants to answer both target selection based questions and "big picture" questions, which are generally related to data aggregation. </p>
  </br>
  </div>
  <h4>What will I be asked to do?</h4>
  <p>If you choose to participate in this study, we will collect data on your response time and accuracy while you answer questions related to the presented streaming data visualization. Specifically, you will be asked questions related to target selection and data aggregation. Target selection is explained below, whereas the data aggregation questions will have to do with either a heatmap or a bar chart. Participants should have an understanding of how to read these before they proceed. The data we gather will be kept confidential and no identifiers linking you to this information will be included in any report that will be kept or published.</p>

  <h4>What is the projected time frame?</h4>
  <p>This study should take no more than 40 minutes of your time. Please set aside adequate time and complete the study in one sitting.
  </p>

  <h4>Instructions</h4>
  <p>In order to complete this study, participants must know how to use the selection techniques and how to utilize the time control mechanic. There are two types of selection techniques offered to the participants; a lasso proxy and a whole screen proxy.
  </p>
  <p>
  The <b>lasso proxy</b> works by users clicking and holding their mouse button while they outline a region. Everything in the selected region then has a proxy (ghost) of itself created and displayed on the screen. This proxy target will not move with time, which makes target selection easier. Performing the lasso action again will clear the old targets and create proxy targets of whatever data is in the new region.
  </p>

  <p>The <b>whole screen proxy</b> will create a proxy of every target currently displayed on the scatterplot. Participants activate this proxy by hitting the left <b>control key</b> key on their keyboard. Hitting <b>control key</b> again will clear the original proxy targets and activate new proxy targets whatever data is currently on the scatterplot. You can also press <b>alt key</b> to clear proxy targets.
  </p>

  <p>The <b>time control mechanics</b> are rather straight forward. There is a play and pause button, a skip forward button, and an icon for the current time position, which can be moved by participants. These time control mechanics work just time control would work for a normal video. The leftmost time is the beggining time for the stream, the center time is where the stream is currently located, and the right most time is 'realtime,' as in the current max time for the stream. This will increase as time goes on. Participants are free to skip back and forth in each of the data streams. Perform this action if you are unable to answer the assigned question by the end of the stream.
  </p>

  <p>Before we can let you continue we want to make sure you test out all of the methods and their combinations. To do this simply use the dropdrowns to change the aggregation and proxy methods then use the proxy method and click one of the dots. You must do this for each combination.</p>
